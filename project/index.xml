      <description>Data library(survival) tdata &amp;lt;- transplant %&amp;gt;% na.omit I will be using transplant data that has informations about the patients on the liver transplant waiting list. The data includes patient&#39;s sex, age, what year they entered the waiting list, futime (time from entry to final disposition), blood type(A,B,O,AB), and the event (final disposition: censored, death, ltx or withdraw). There are 815 observations total, but I will be removing all the observations with NAs, which comes down to 797 observations.</description>

      <description>Introduction: The two data I have chosen both deal with women participating in the labor force from carData. I thought this would be interesting to see the factors that impact women&#39;s participation in labor force. I expect that not having children would increase the rate of labor force participation, and an increased participation when husband&#39;s income is lower.
The Mroz data frame has 753 rows and 8 columns, and the observations, from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, are married women.</description>
